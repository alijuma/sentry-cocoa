# We received a customer report that ASAN reports a use-after-free error after
# calling UIImage(named:) with an empty string argument. Recording another
# transaction leads to the ASAN error.
- launchApp
# this primes the state required according to the customer report, by setting a UIImageView.image property to a UIImage(named: "")
- tapOn: "Use-after-free"
# this causes another transaction to be recorded which hits the codepath necessary for the ASAN to trip
- tapOn: "Extra"
